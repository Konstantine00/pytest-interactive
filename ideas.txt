outstandings:
- don't require a -s so output can still be supressed
- overall usage docs
- magics docs


features:
- consider running tests from a fixture such as
  this:http://pytest.org/latest/example/special.html
- ability to invoke fixtures for a test from ipshell
  -> switch to state A, run some tests, restore, switch to state B
     run some other tests...etc.
- instead of 'tt' as the base ref why not use the test dir name?
 -> obvs means announcing it at the splash and inserting it in the shell ns
    (we can keep tt there as well)
- rerun the last pytest selection without exitting from the parent
  process (i.e. resume the ipshell with it's current state
  -> is there a way to save this state across pytest sessions/processes?
- when debugger is hit offer a list of fixturevalues which can be
  played with to see the state of resources/devices involved in the test
  -> maybe allow user to enter into the previous ipshell+state?
- pytest session time shouldn't include ipython time??


DONE - select subsets of a parametrized test instances by callspec id
DONE - history from this shell saved for exclusive re-use
DONE - pretty printer for default __repr__
DONE - move ipshell stuff to separate module and only load when config.capture != 'no'
DONE - show item selection in the ipython prompt
DONE - allow for index/slice selection of any test subset
