outstandings:
- select subsets of a parametrized test instances
  -> organize by fixture, parametrize call?
- allow for index/slice selection of any test subset

features:
- show item selection in the ipython prompt
- ability to invoke fixtures for a test from ipshell
  -> switch to state A, run some tests, restore, switch to state B
     run some other tests...etc.
- rerun the last pytest selection without exitting from the parent
  process (i.e. resume the ipshell with it's current state
- when debugger is hit offer a list of fixturevalues which can be
  played with to see the state of resources/devices involved in the test
  -> maybe allow user to enter into the previous ipshell+state?
