pytest-interactive: select and run your tests using IPython
============================================================

This rather exquisite plugin allows for the selection and run of pytest tests
using the command line facilities available in IPython. This includes tab completion
along the pytest node hierarchy and test callspec ids as well as the use of
standard python subscript and slice syntax for selection.

Upon invocation with either the ``--interactive`` or shorthand ``--ia`` arguments,
you will enter an interactive python shell which allows for navigation of the test
tree built during pytest's collection phase.
